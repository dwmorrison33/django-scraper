# django-scraper
The purpose of this django project was to write a scraper with selenium and beautifulsoup and then insert that data in the ORM. I used postgres as my backend database, set up on my local machine. There are no views or urls in this project yet, the goal was simply to write a scraper and insert that data ito the ORM for use later in dynamically displaying that data on a map
